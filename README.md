# surfs_up

## Overview:
Developing a business plan for a new business venture that combines a Surf and Ice Cream Shop, serving local residents and tourists, in Oahu, Hawaii. Part of the business plan is providing enough data to attract additional investor funding.  
One potential investor remains somewhat hesitant due to a previous failed experience in a similar business earlier in their career. Their previous endeavor faltered primarily because of a lack of planning and research regarding weather conditions.
The potential investor has requested specific temperature data for the months of June and December. 
By analyzing this information, they want to evaluate whether the Surf and Ice Cream Shop can sustainably operate throughout the year.

The main objective is to offer the potential investor, as well as any future investors, comprehensive data and insights that will inspire confidence in their investment.

•	June: Average temperature is around 75 degrees, ranging anywhere with a low of 64 degrees and a max temperature of 85.

•	December: Average temperature is around 71 degrees, ranging anywhere with a low of 56 degrees and a max temperature of 83.

•	The weather data recorded for December amounted to 1,517 instances, whereas a total of 1,700 weather data points were documented for June.


## Summary:

Hawaii appears to have consistently warm weather year round, making it an ideal location for establishing a surfboard and ice cream business. The favorable weather conditions throughout the year create a promising environment for both activities.

However, it's important to consider other factors that can influence people's interest in surfing and their desire for ice cream. To gain deeper insights, further investigations can be conducted to examine variations in precipitation, as well as sun and cloud cover, throughout the year. These additional queries will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics and help make informed decisions regarding the business venture.
